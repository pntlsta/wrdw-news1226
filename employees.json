Raised right here in the CSRA, I’ve built my career on relationships with my incredible team, our loyal clients, and this amazing community I love calling home.\n\nFor the past 14 and half years, I’ve been the Executive Producer of our call-in show LawCall on WRDW, which basically means on Sunday nights, I help the Lawyers give legal insight to viewers that makes sense. Outside of sales and legal talk, I’ve been a proud advocate for the American Heart Association for over a decade. I use my Southern charm to help raise awareness and rally support, and it’s one of the most rewarding hats I wear. Whether I’m brainstorming campaign ideas with the sales team, cheering on a client’s success, or just making sure everyone has enough caffeine to survive a Monday, I try to bring heart, hustle, and humor to everything I do.\n\nAt home, I’m a wife and proud mom of three, which means I occasionally feel like a referee, short-order cook, motivational speaker, and unpaid Uber driver... all before 8 a.m. Have I mastered the whole work-life balance thing? Not even close. But I show up every day with a full to-do list, a big smile, and the hope that I remembered to bring a pair of heels, instead of my house shoes.\n\nMy goal is simple: keep learning, keep growing, and keep helping my team and our clients win, one idea, one laugh, and one (very large) cup of coffee/snack at a time.",

After spending 3 years as a Creative Services Producer in Fort Wayne, IN, where my career began, I had the opportunity to take a job in Cleveland, OH, where I was able to sharpen my skills. 3 years in Cleveland taught me so much, and with that knowledge, I decided to take the next step and was accepted into Gray Media’s corporate marketing leadership program.\n\nAfter spending a year learning different aspects of the job, I was happy to accept my first Creative Services Director position here in Augusta.
